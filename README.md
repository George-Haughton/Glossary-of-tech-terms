## 10 Scrum definitions

### Team 
A team or 'scrum team' is normally comprised of seven plus or minus two people.The team is normally a mix of different types of developers. Some examples of the different kinds of backgrounds involved are Architects, Testers, Programmers, software engineers, QA experts, analysts and UI designers. This is normally called cross-functional project teams. During the sprint the team will self organize themselves with help with the ScrumMaster who is the leader/guardian who ensures that the group are insulated from the product owner.

### Sprint Backlogs
A sprint backlog is a log that defines the tasks that need to be completed to find out the sprints goals.

### Impediments 
A Impediment is anything that stops any member of the team doijg their job effectively and as well as they possibly could. At the daily scrum meeting every team member has the opportunity to present any Impediments they have come across. Another job that the ScrumMaster is in charge of is solving these Impediments within the daily scrum meeting; if they cannot be resolved then and there, the ScrumMaster will setup one or multiple sidebar meetings to make sure they get resolved.

### Burndown charts
These charts show any work that is remaining overtime. The time is the X axis and the work remaining is the Y axis; the work remaining should move up and down but eventually trend downward.

### Daily Scrum meeting
This is on average a 15 minute meeting each day (for every team member) which discusses and asks the team members three simple questions: 'What have you done since the last Scrum meeting i.e what did you do yesterday', 'What are you going to do before the next Scrum meeting i.e what are you doing to do today' and finally 'What prevents me from performing my work as efficently as possible?'. Additionally the ScrumMaster will make sure members call sidebar meetings for a discussion on anything that goes too far outside of the meetings constraints.

### Velocity
Within Scrum, Velocity is how much product backlog effort a team can withstand within one sprint. A good way to estimate this is too look back on the Scrums previous sprints, assuming the teams sprint duration and composotion are kept constant. If they are not then you can also use a sprint-by-sprint analysis; using commitment based planning.

### Scrum Roles
Their are three essential/main roles for a Scrum. Firstly, we have the Product Owner who is focused on understaning market and business requirements
